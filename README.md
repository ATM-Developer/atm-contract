## ATM Introduction
Autonomous Trust Momentum is a decentralized mechanism deployed on multiple blockchains. With the use of our main mechanism, the consensus contract, two users can lock value for a predefined period. With the creation of many of these connections, we hope that a network of consensus contracts will emerge – otherwise known as a relative consensus network. 

Decentralized finance is already a form of consensus network – it allows people to establish consensus in a decentralised system using blockchain technology. This current system is based on the individual and their impulses: they can buy today and sell tomorrow. ATM aims to solve this by constructing a new form of consensus, built on the strength of social networks rather than the fragility of the individual.



## ATM Smart Contract-Consensus Contract
By leveraging our consensus contract two users can lock value for a predefined period. This is what we mean by consensus connection. 

As consensus connections between users are continuously established, and a huge relative consensus network emerges.


## The content of the consensus contract includes:

#### Both users need to confirm:
User A sets up a consensus contract which initiates a request to establish a connection to user B. If B agrees, the contract will be executed, and the consensus connection will be successful.

#### Locked Token:
Any cryptocurrency supported by ATM;

#### Investment amount:
The value that both parties agree upon - It does not have to be equal for both users;

#### Lock-up time:
The length of time for which the investment amount will be locked;

#### Contract cancellation:
During the lock-up time, either user cannot cancel the contract on their own. They must wait until the end of the contract or reach agreement with one another to terminate it early. Upon expiration, the contract will remain valid if neither party has decided to cancel.

## Wormhole
In physics, a wormhole - also known as an Einstein-Rosen Bridge - is a narrow tunnel connecting two different places in space-time directly. In ATM, “wormhole” refers to connection contracts that operate between different blockchain. Users can connect their wallet addresses on different public chains using the wormhole contract provided by ATM, and in ATMRank the addresses on the two public chains would be regarded as a single node in the relative consensus network. Through the merging of cross-chain addresses across different public chains we hope that fractured networks will instead become a single integrated community.
